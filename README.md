# US Flight Delay Analysis - Winter Season (2018-2019)

This project aims to analyze the Air Traffic Delay behavior in US airports, in the winter season of 2018-2019. In order to provide a descriptive analysis, that will bring wider understanding of flight delays behavior in airport operations. 

## Getting oriented (:

### Notebooks:
* First Approach - This notebook is not part of the study, it is an initial test. Getting oriented with a test dataset of January 2015
* 01.Data Preparation - Set up for the data base, prior to the analysis phase. It includes: the data loading, the merging of the three different datasets, the data trimming and finally the treating of null values.
