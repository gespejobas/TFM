# US Flight Delay Analysis - Winter Season (2018-2019)

This project aims to analyze the Air Traffic Delay behavior in US airports, in the winter season of 2018-2019. In order to provide a descriptive analysis, that will bring wider understanding of flight delays behavior in airport operations. 

## Getting oriented

### Notebooks
* First Approach - This notebook is not part of the study, it is an initial test. Getting oriented with a test dataset of January 2015
* 01.Data Preparation - Set up for the data base, prior to the analysis phase. It includes: the data loading, the merging of the three different datasets, the data trimming and finally the treating of null values.
* 02.Data Inspection & Representation - This notebook contains the inspection of the data, and its representations. That means we will be looking at: delay distributions and correlations, season analysis (contextualitzation of the working data: flight categoritzation and timeline analysis) and an Air Traffic Congestion Study.
* 03.Data Analysis & Representation - This notebook contains the main analysis and representations of the Air Traffic Delay Study, in the following fields of study: airports, routes and carriers.

## Data Source

Flight data was sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), of the United States Department of Transportation. The dataset utilized is the “Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance” for months: December 2018, January 2019 and February 2019. The data includes scheduled and actual departure and arrival times, canceled and diverted flights, taxi-out and taxi-in times, causes of delay and cancellation, air time, and non-stop distance, etc.
